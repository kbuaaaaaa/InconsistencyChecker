OUR LIST OF OBJECTIVES:
	For the next sprint our main objective is to create a working prototype that ideally, uses 
both the inspector tool and the standard template tool.
Inspector tool:
•	Make an appropriate output that shows the differences between two elements.
•	Try to compare two elements from two(if possible extend it to take on more than two elements) different pages and also output the differences within those two elements.
Standard Template tool:
•	Use the email that the customer sent us as the basis for the template and set it as our main standard template for all properties.
•	If that does not suit the customers needs, implement an algorithm so that after one use of the program we store properties that can be used as a standard template.
Another goal is to make sure that the parameters the users can enter are applicable to a non-technical users and find a way to formally present this in the extension tool.
Another goal was to make the issues on gitlab more specific to the assignee so that goal of the ticket could easily be identified.
