## Customer Days

[Marksheet](www.google.com)

## Final Demonstration

**40 marks**

- In front of the whole class
- Power point presentation (visual aides) and a live demonstration of the product
- Things to outline:
  1.  Motivation for the project
  2.  Key achievements
  3.  Technical challenges
  4.  Technical decisions made during the project
  5.  Rationale for the choices made
- It's expected that we have a live demonstration prepared
  - We will not be penalised for any issues that may arise during the demo as long as we have some back-up (screen shots in the presentation, a video)
- We will be assessed on having a _working_ release
  - The project delivers value (it is usable by the costumer)
  - The project is viable for future development (it is maintainable)

### Mark scheme

- (5 marks) Clear explanation of motivation of the project
- (5 marks) Outline of key achievements, product features, technical features and challenges
- (5 marks) Live demonstration and use of supplementary visual aids
- **(20 marks) Completion of handover process to costumer**

## Software Product

**80 marks**

- Assessed by course coordinators
- Equal weight to ambition and the quality
  - Projects that aim to be prototypes should be more ambitious
  - Projects that aim to deliver products, should focus on the quality at the expense of features

### Mark scheme

- **(50 marks) Ambition/challenge/achievements**
  - The project will be assessed in terms of what was achieved, but this will be weighted against the original difficulty involved
- (10 marks) Design
  - Is there a correspondence between high level design documentation and actual implementation (i.e. is the documentation useful)?
  - Is there a careful separation of concerns between different modules/responsibilities in the design?
  - Is there low coupling between different modules?
  - Would the design be easy to extend with new features?
  - Do software metrics indicate areas of high coupling or poor modularity?
- (10 marks) Implementation
  - Does the implementation that follow a consistent style?
  - Is there a use of explicit identifiers for modules, methods and variable (as appropriate)?
  - Are functions short and comprehensible with low nesting?
  - Is the level of code documentation _appropriate_ (i.e. neither absent nor excessive) use of program documentation will be highly credited.
- (10 marks) Organisation
  - Is the software product directory well organised according to language/platform conventions?
  - Is there a user guide present (e.g. README.txt)?
  - Is the release accompanied by release notes documenting new features and known bugs?
  - Can the code be compiled and tested automatically?
  - Can the release be installed automatically?

## Software Process

**100 marks**

- Final summative assessment of the software process
- Same mark scheme as formative assessments

### Mark scheme

- (25 marks) Change management
  - Did the team make small, frequent commits to the project SCM?
  - **Did each commit have a useful log message describing the purpose and rationale for the change, linked to the project management system?**
    - Commit messages need to include rationale, actions and references to tickets
  - Did the team have established practices for managing concurrent change (e.g. branching).
- (25 marks) Project Planning
  - Was the project actively managed through the project management system?
  - Were tasks updated as progress was made?
  - Were new tasks created as the team discovered new tasks?
  - Was task meta data (priority, estimates etc.) documented?
- (25 marks) Quality assurance
  - **Was every commit tested in a continuous integration environment?**
    - The CI/CD pipeline does nothing as of now, there is no test suite
  - **Did the team immediately fix any broken builds report by the CI environment?**
    - The pipeline was broken for a while
  - **Did the team have an automated test suite for regression testing purposes?**
    - There is no test suite
  - **Did the test suite provided effective coverage of the project?**
  - Did the team perform code reviews (evidence from wiki or commit messages)?
- (25 marks) Process improvement
  - Did the team hold regular post-iteration retrospectives?
  - Were the retrospectives used effectively to (a) identify problems and (b) identify practical solutions?
  - Were the results of the retrospectives documented?
  - **Were the solutions implemented?**
    - There are tickets with the tasks that come up after each retrospective but these are not updated
  - Was the effectiveness of a solution evaluated?

## Dissertation

**100 marks**
