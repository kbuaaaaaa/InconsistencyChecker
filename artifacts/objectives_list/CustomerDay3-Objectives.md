# Objectives after Customer Day 3

For the next sprint our main objective is to create a working prototype that ideally uses both the inspector tool and the standard template tool.

Inspector tool:

- Make an appropriate output that shows the differences between two elements
- Try to compare two elements from two different pages (if possible extend it to take on more than two elements). Also output the differences between those two elements.

Standard template tool:

- Use the email the customer sent us as the basis for the template and set it as our main standard template for all properties.
- If that does not suit the customer needs, implement an algorithm that after one use of the program we store properties that can be used as a standard template.

Other objectives:

- Make sure the parameters the users can enter are applicable to a non-technical user and find a way to formally present these in the extension tool
- Mek the issues on GitLab more specific to the asssignee so that the goal of the ticket can easily be identified
