# Objectives after Customer Day 4

Theme: **Generalisation**

- Template for general comparison(not targeting any specific UI-element, and using the email Adam sent us)
- Implementing basic buttons for custom template builder(this would primarily just consist of buttons and a User-Interface with our intended new features to show the customer and see if it is to their liking
- Ascertain a method for gathering the data (class IDs etc.)that we need for our program to function.
- Modify the tool to work with the template, adding addition functionality to template builder
- Finalising our additional "import" and "export functionalities
- Implement the additional drop downs to allow users to customise their template
- Drop-down section to allow users to pick from a variety of UI-elements to use for the basis of the comparison
- Clickable report(interactive) and possibly, if we have additional time, Implement a feature that highlights the UI-elements that are being compared.
