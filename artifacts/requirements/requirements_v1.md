# Requirements

- Browser extension
- Give UI parameters
- Ability to select a UI component in a whole screen shot and get the component's parameters
- Get a report of the inconsistencies (the ouput of the program)
- "Merge request checker": before anything gets added to the website make sure that it is consistent with other elements/webpages
  - Similar to the requirement below but instead of comparing 2 deployed pages, you compare 1 under development and 1 already deployed
  - This would be “extra” so it’s not necessary
- Ability to check inconsistencies across multiple pages
  - Add this as a parameter in the browser extension: include which other webpages the user wants to check
- Ability to identify exactly where the inconsistencies are (visually/source code)
