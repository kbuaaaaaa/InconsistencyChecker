# Touchpoint

## Meeting

**Ideas for small changes:**

- Change label of "Select property" to "Select property type"
- Change name of "Compare template" tab to "Inconsistency checker"
  - Changing order of tabs to:
  - Template builder
  - Inconsistency checker
  - Compare elements
- Add "Empty"/none values to dropdowns: at the moment we can leave properties with input boxes empty, but not those with dropdown options, so the inconsistency checker always compares properties like font style, font variant, etc. which have dropdown options
- Either:
  - Only have an Upload template button on the "Compare template" tab //
  - If we have an upload template button on the template builder tab then the user will probably expect to be able to see the properties from the uploaded template on this page and be able to edit them. This would be good but do we have time for this?
- Now we have both a clear and reset button on the template builder which feels redundant and less intuitive, should we only have one button that both clears and resets?

**Tasks:**

- Highlight element when hovering over "Show details"
- Button to show details of all inconsistencies at once
- Adding ID of element to show details
