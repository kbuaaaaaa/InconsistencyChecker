     - Standardised
   - Add a "new template"
     - Defining the class (@Bua)
     - List of drop-downs: (@Xinming & @Alex)
       - UI element (the template is centered around this)
       - Category: property(font, colour, icons) & values (px, colours, etc)
       - Ideally this creates an object that we can use to compare
     - Export (@Sarahi)
       - Get the object as a string, and return it as a text file to the user

       - Parse the text file, and create the object
