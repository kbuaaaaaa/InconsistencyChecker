## Meeting

- 2 people focus on UI, the rest focus on refactoring and testing
  - Headers are inconsistent (@Xinming)
  - Buttons (@Xinming)
    - Too close to each other
    - Text is inconsistent (lowercase, capitals)
  - Comparison tool page (@Alex)
    - Columns not aligned
    - Buttons move around if you resize the input boxes
  - Helper icons (@Bua)
    - The question mark is not centered
    - Text is not consistent
- Functional improvements

  - "Reset button": if you click save multiple times the items are repeated (@Rojhat)
    - Check that there are no duplicate objects ~ if you hit save and haven’t added any new objects, don’t add them into the template
    - Reset button also necessary to clean up the template, and clear all button to delete all the properties on the builder
  - Add more default values (@Alex)
    - Font names: amazon amber, arial, etc
    - When you create the template, you already have some text in the box
  - Input checks: when you put a colour in hex code if there are any characters that should not be there (not a priority)

- Refactoring (@Sarahi)

  - Break down the `panel.js` file
  - Clean up the `panel.html` file
    - Create different html files for each page

- Testing
  - UnitJS
