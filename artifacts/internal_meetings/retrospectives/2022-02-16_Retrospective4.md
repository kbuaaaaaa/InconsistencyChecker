# Retrospective 4

> 16 February 2022

## Retrospective

### Start

1. Follow the software process
   - **Action** Develop a concrete action plan (@Sarahi)
     - Review the marking guidelines
     - Review formative assessments and improve based on Alex's feedback
     - Compare the expectations to our project: what is missing and what we need to focus on
2. Divide bigger tasks
   - Raise if you found yourself involved in a task that's way bigger than expected
   - Discuss and divide the task again
3. Monitor the tasks
   - Write comments in the tickets
   - Let everyone when your branch is ready for review
   - **Action** Monitor comments in the tickets (@Rojhat)
4. Write better commit messages
   - See [this](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
   - **Action** Monitor commit messages (@Alex)
5. Adding more code comments
   - Part of refactoring, we will focus on this when we tackle refactoring
   - **Action** Add it as a part of the refactoring tasks (@Sarahi)
6. Documentation
   - We need to add documentation in the wiki page (they do this in some other projects)
   - **Action** Write documentation drafts (@Rojaht)
7. Approach the tickets properly
   - **Action** Remind team members of the process for working on a ticket (@Sarahi)
8. Testing
   - Task we have in our backlog, we will focus on this
9. Summary for every meeting
   - **Action** Add a summary at the end of every meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page (@Sarahi)

### Stop

1. Ask for help when you need it
   - It will save us time and will help us be more efficient
   - **Action** See Start (3)
2. Start working on the issues on Monday or Tuesday
   - Check up on team members and ensure they have started working before Monday
   - **Action** Ensure on Mondays that merge requests are created and ready to be resolved (@Bua)
3. Merging without reviewing the changes
   - **Action** Assign a reviewer to your merge request once you are ready to resolver (@Everyone)
     - Check other merge requests' reviewers to avoid overworking a single team member
4. Ignoring the retrospective tasks
   - **Action** Remind team members of their roles form the retrospective (@Sarahi)
5. Leaving overdue tickets
   - **Action** Monitor due dates and talk to assignees of overdue tickets (@Xinming)
6. Saturday meeting
   - Scrap it, we do not really need it

### Continue

1. Our communication has improved
2. We have been more structured and organised since the last retrospective
   - Better tickets
   - Meeting agendas, meetings structure
3. Contributing as much as we are doing now
4. Taking initiative
5. Working on the tickets every week

## Issues from the last retrospective

- We have been working on the structure of meetings
- We are more organised now
- Our goals are more clear now

## Conclusions

- Our goals are more clear so we have managed to create and follow more structured tasks, however we are not following the software process as much as we should.
- We are still struggling when it comes to follow up on retrospective tasks, so we have to take more care of that.
- We tend to forget about GitLab tickets, but we have hopefully introduced some ways to fix this.
