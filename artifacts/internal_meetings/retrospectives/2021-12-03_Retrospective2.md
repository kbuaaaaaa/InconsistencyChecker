## Retrospective

### Start

1. Speaking more during meetings:
   - Having stand-ups: everyone has to talk about what they did and where they are (5 minutes each)
   - **Action** Organise and leading stand-ups (@Bua)
2. Having clear requirements:
   - Retry with user stories: now we have much more information, so we can create better ones
   - We can also confirm this with Adam
   - Keep them somewhere accesible (GitLab)
   - **Action** Gather everyone's user stories and put it all together (@Alex)
3. Improve communication with Aga:
   - Email Adam and ask for her email (if she's okay with that)
   - Focus the customer meetings around Aga
   - **Action** Ask for Aga's email and email her(@Rojhat)
4. Move onto conding
5. Instead of asking, present Adam with concise questions:
   - **Action** Check the questions and make sure that they are close-ended. (@Rojhat)
6. Pushing to GitLab more often:
   - **Action** Make sure that everyonen is adding meaningful contributions to the repo (@Sarahi)
7. Update the team when you find interesting information
8. Creating more concise GitLab tickets:

## Conclusions

(Add retrospective tickets to GitLab @Sarahi)

- We have improved a lot when it comes to communication with the customer (both meetings and emails).

- We have realised that we need to split tasks more equally, so we have tried to do so with the actions that have come in this retrospective.

- We have realised that we need to start implementing all the features and designs we have been discussing. We may have spent more time than expected trying to come up with a perfect solution, instead of creating a solution and slowly improving it.
