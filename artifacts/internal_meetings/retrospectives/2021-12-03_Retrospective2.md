## Retrospective

### Start

- Speaking more during meetings:
  - Having stand-ups: everyone has to talk about what they did and where they are (5 minutes each)
  - **Action** Organise and leading stand-ups (@Bua)
- Having clear requirements:
  - Retry with user stories: now we have much more information, so we can create better ones
  - We can also confirm this with Adam
  - Keep them somewhere accesible (GitLab)
  - **Action** Gather everyone's user stories and put it all together (@Alex)
- Improve communication with Aga:
  - Email Adam and ask for her email (if she's okay with that)
  - Focus the customer meetings around Aga
  - **Action** Ask for Aga's email and email her(@Rojhat)

- Instead of asking, present Adam with concise questions:
  - **Action** Check the questions and make sure that they are close-ended. (@Rojhat)
- Pushing to GitLab more often:
  - **Action** Make sure that everyonen is adding meaningful contributions to the repo (@Sarahi)

- Creating more concise GitLab tickets:

## Conclusions

(Add retrospective tickets to GitLab @Sarahi)

- We have improved a lot when it comes to communication with the customer (both meetings and emails).

- We have realised that we need to split tasks more equally, so we have tried to do so with the actions that have come in this retrospective.

- We have realised that we need to start implementing all the features and designs we have been discussing. We may have spent more time than expected trying to come up with a perfect solution, instead of creating a solution and slowly improving it.
