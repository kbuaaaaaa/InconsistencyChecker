## Meeting

**Questions for Adam**

1. Do you want us to make a Chrome or Firefox extension?
2. What are your top priorities in consistencies?
3. Do you have any framework recommendations for JavaScript?

**Sprint Planning**

1. Learn JavaScript (whole sprint, ongoing ticket)
2. Finalise GitLab tutorial (before this weekend)
   - OpenStack cluster (not Rojhat)
   - Branching!!!!!! (Watch lecture and decide) (assign to someone) **Before writing any code**
3. (Very) Basic browser extension (2h) [2 people]
   - Follow Chrome tutorial (Alex, Sarahi)
4. Tech stack (3h) [1 person for each] (divide among the rest) - Are there any JS frameworks that make traversing the DOM easier? - Are there any frameworks recommended for browser extensions? - Multi-browser extensions and how much they differ from chromium extensions (specially Firefox)
   Working but basic extension, frameworks, multi-browser extensions.
5. Learn how to traverse the DOM (2h for each person) - How to traverse the tree - When to stop traversing the tree ~ top priorities for inconsistencies - Study properties (based on Adam’s response)  
   Know how to traverse the DOM, we are comfortable with elements and properties
6. List of inconsistencies to focus on (1h) [2 people]
   - Top priority from Adam
   - List of examples he sent us
   - Any other example we found along the way
7. Rough list of parameters for the extension (1h) [2 people]
8. Grouping elements for detecting inconsistencies v1 (2h) [3 people] - First version of it, we’ll need more iterations
   Grouping elements in the UI -> big task, Adam’s help
9. Another version for grouping elements together (v2) in the UI (to be divided later)
