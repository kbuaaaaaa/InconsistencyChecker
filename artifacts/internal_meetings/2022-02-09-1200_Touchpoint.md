# Touchpoint after February 09

> 9th February 12pm

## Agenda

1. Discuss what Adam said on the meeting
2. Create and divide tasks
3. Prepare for the next customer day (next week)

## Meeting

1. Discuss the meeting
   - We are okay in terms of functionality (the extension is doing what we want it to do), but we have to improve usability
     - Inconsistency of the buttons, input fields
     - Tabs instead of buttons to change between the different pages
     - Button labels not intuitive
   - From what Adam said: refine the extension
   - Functionality is not done yet:
     - We are not able to compare multiple properties
     - Filter out elements that are scripts or line break etc (elements we want to compare have as name an html tag type)
     - Blank fields in the template creation form
     - Download and choose file buttons don't do anything yet (import-export)
     - Now we are comparing the elemnts as string comparison: we want to create an object and compare the object
2. Task division:
   - Usability tasks
     - Input fields are inconsistent (template creation page)
     - Change from buttons to tabs
     - Button labels are not intuitive (changing the label, adding some helper text)
   - Functionality tasks
     - Compare multiple properties
     - Filter out irrelevant elements
     - Ignore blank fields in the template creation form
     - Properly add the import-export functionality
     - Change from string comparison to object comparison (not priority, it's working but it's not ideal)
3. Preparation for next meeting:
   - Finish up the usability issues Adam brought up
   - Fix up all the functionality issues
   - Get a live demo of a tool that looks professional (to Adam) and that it's working properly
   - Code freeze 18th March
   - Another set of things to bring up, but for next week: testing, pipeline, wiki, readme, gitignore, dissertation (?)
