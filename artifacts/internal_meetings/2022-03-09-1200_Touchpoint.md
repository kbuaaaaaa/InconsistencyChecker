# Touchpoint

> 9th March 2022

## Meeting

Next week is the code freeze: 18th March 23:59

New tasks from the meeting with Adam:

- Edit the template: load the template into the template builder and edit it and then save it again (@Bua)
- Headers are not properly aligned: either move the buttons to the center or move the header to the left (@Alex)
- Text in buttons is not consistent (Expand All vs Display template) Either all of them are capitalised or only the first one, but don't combine 2 styles (@Xinming)
- Change the style of the tabs button to make it clear that they are tabs (now they seem like any other button, and the style seems inconsistent)(@Rojhat)

Tasks related to the course assessment:

- Add the [Product](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/4779699/mod_resource/content/5/template.md) and [Process](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/4779698/mod_resource/content/4/template.md) pages to the wiki
	- Software Process:
		- Change management (@Xinming) 
		- Project planning (@Rojhat)
		- Quality assurance (@Rojhat)
		- Process improvement (@Alex)
	- Software Product (@Sarahi)
- Remaining tests (@Bua)
- Send Adam an email about the licensing and the handover (@Sarahi)

- Update the `README.md` (@Alex)
- Add the release notes (@Sarahi)
- Plan and divide the [dissertation](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2568549):
	- Introduction (1 page): purpose of the document, outline of the project, structure of the dissertation
	- Description of the case study and the context (1-3 pages): discuss the customer, the objectives for the project and what was actually achieved
	- Reflection (8-10 pages) several sections, discuss a theme and the indicents that arised from which we learned
		- Try to relate experiencies to other studies available in the software engineering literature
		- Each of us does a section: choose a theme and think of the incidents that arised
		- Code reviews: we weren't doing them at the beginning, then we had the workshop and this was very helpful :) (@Alex)
		- Distance barrier: Xinming was not here wit us in Glasgow, the issues that arised and how we tried to fix them (@Xinming)
		- Lack of direction at the start: we weren't really sure of what we had to do, we tried the user stories but it didn't really help (@Rojhat)
		- Machine learning: how were we thinking of implementing it, why didn't we do it (@Bua)
		- Team communication: how was our communication at the beginning, what were the problems with it, what did we do to improve it, how was the communication at the end of the project (@Sarahi)
	- Conclusion (1-2 pages): lessons learned
	- References (1-2 pages)
- Ideally we will have a second release before the code freeze, the first release is what we have on master now (@Sarahi)
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to explain how we handle branches
