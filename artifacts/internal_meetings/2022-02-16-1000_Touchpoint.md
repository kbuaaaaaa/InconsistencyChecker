# Touchpoint before Customer Day 4

> 16th February 10am

## Agenda

1. Sprint plan: tasks and week planning
2. Handover process: how and when
3. Other issues and questions

## Meeting

1. Sprint plan
   - Testing
   - Refactor code
   - Documentation
   - Functionality improvements:
     - Input checks
     - Reset button in the template because if you save multiple times then the items are repeated
     - Add more default values
   - UI improvements:
     - Headers are inconsistent (some in caps, some lowercase, some do not even have a header)
     - Input fields are inconsistent (Xinming is working on this)
     - Comparison tool columns are not aligned
     - The buttons are usually too close to each other
     - The helper is too big and does not look good
     - In "Comparison tool" the buttons move around if you resize the input boxes
     - In "Compare template" the output box has disappeared
     - Text in buttons is inconsistent (some in caps, some in lowercase, some capitalised)
     - Some other tweaks necessary
   - Potential updates:
     - Change from manifest v2 to manifest v3 if we want to deploy to the chrome webstore (easier if we decide to drop the SnappySnippet tool)
2. Handover plan:
   - Clear statment on medium and long term goals for the project
     - Easy way: publish it to GitHub with an appropriate license (GNU license)
     - Do we really need the compare 2 elements tab? If not, we can just get rid of it and all of the rest is our own code so we can just transfer the rights to them (ask for something in exchange?)
   - Give Adam access to the code
   - Documentation: README and wiki
     - What should the documentation include?
       - How to use the tool
       - How to load it (if we decide not to deploy it to the webstore)
3. Other issues and questions:
   - Retrospective is pending
