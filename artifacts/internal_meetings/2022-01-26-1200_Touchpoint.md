## Meeting

1. Plan for next week:

   - We will still be focusing on the goal for the week according to the sprint plan, but we will change the approach
     1. Adam has told us that trying to find the elements in the page via the `className` may not be the only solution
     2. We can select a `div` and compare **all** the elements within that `div` (`div` or a container, or an area on the screen)
     3. Compare all the elements based on one porperty or just a couple properties: so that we don't get all the elements
     4. Requirement: multiple values for a certain property in the template (borders that are 10px and 20px)

2. Tasks:

   - Add the dropdowns properly (somewhere else, add them to the tool)

     - Xinming’s base + CSS (Alex)

     - Give it functionality: a button creates a template object

   - Close off the import/export thing

     - Trying to put node.js in the project -> this might break everything

   - Making ephemeral templates: editable, select the properties you want to check, but there’s no need to save them

   - Goal for next week: working themplate creator
   - GitLab tasks:
     - Feature branching
     - CI/CD pipeline
     - Leave chrome-extension alone, don't work there!
