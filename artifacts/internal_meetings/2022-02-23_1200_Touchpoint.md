# Touchpoint

> 23rd February 12pm

## Meeting

- We have mostly covered the main UI issues we had
  - There are still some minor tweaks and things to adjust
    - Someone needs to go over that and signal what to change (@Xinming)
    - The ouput box in "Compare template" disappeared (@Xinming)
- Usability:
  - Add a clear button to clear the details of the previous comparison OR when clicking compare, ensure that the text is cleared before comparing (@Rojhat)
- Refactoring is going to stop us for a day or two
- Testing (@Bua)
  - [UnitJS](https://unitjs.com/)
  - [Installation instructions for the browser](https://unitjs.com/guide/browser.html)
  - Once the refactoring is done, someone shoudl start writing tests
  - Test the functions, ensure they are working fine, etc
  - Change the functions? Right now our functions do not return anything but change the internal state, how do we test that?
- Writing the documentation (@Alex)
  - Rojhat has already started to work on it
  - Available on the wiki
  - How to install and set up in the browser
  - How to use each page
- Update the CI/CD pipeline to include linting in the "build" stage (@Sarahi)
