## Meeting

Response to feedback from Yehia:

1. Journey from last meeting: what were we supposed to do, what did we do, how are we stuck
2. Goal of the sprint: working prototype?

   - Xinming: highlighting in red the areas that are inconsistent
     - Based on “standard values”
     - How do we get the standard values?? QUESTION
     - Are standards something _abstract_ or are they based on elements from the page?
   - Bua: selecting 2 elements and getting the properties
   - Prototype: combination of the 2. The user can see which elements are inconsistent, and compare the properties (compare the element vs the standard)

3. Main task: get the standards
4. Theme: working prototype
5. Time boxing? Whatever he meant
6. Quick little summary at the end of the meeting
