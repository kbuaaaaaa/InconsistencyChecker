# Customer Meeting

- We already managed to create templates and allow the user to compare against every element in this page
  - Find all the elements that have properties different than the template (so far we can only do font)
  - Highlight the elements that come up (one by one)
- Requirements:
  - Have a button at the top that says "expand all"
- What happens if we leave something blank -> think about this
- Suggestions:
  - Understand the functionality -> does this look like something professional?
  - Does it make sense for the steps you have in the flow? The buttons in the top?
  - Different fields with different style
  - Buttons with different style
  - Random choose file: is this intuitive for the user?
  - Make it look like tabs rather than buttons
- In terms of functionality is _great_, but we can make it better and we can make it more intuitive
  - It is a good baseline
  - We can focus a little on usability
- Goal: refine it!
