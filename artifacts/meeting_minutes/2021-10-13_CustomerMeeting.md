# Customer Meeting 1

## Overview

The library is like a block for construction and many services in the product family use the same library.
They are also developed by different teams and sometimes they don't do the right design: colour, font size, spacing, etc.

They want some tools that will let them know where the UI inconsistencies are.

The Amazon web family are over a 100, and they are built by different teams. However, all amazon webpages should be identical in terms of spacing, etc. They will let us do it with [amazon.com](amazon.com) first and they will take it to use with the others in the family.

## UI elements

- Colour
- Font: font size
- Spacing
- Button location
- Pattern
- Component

[amazon.com](amazon.com) is built by many different teams. If we go through pages in [amazon.com](amazon.com) we need to make suer that every page is identical.

## What they expect

Bring our own ideas. Maybe a browser plugin like going to the web and we can make a button to give them a report of where the inconsistency is. Hopefully, it will be something that uses parameters so they can take our work and modify the apremeter to use with the other webs.

## Requirements

They can give us specific requirements but they won't because that wil make us miss the important element of this course which is communicating with our customer.

They want to be able to set different parameters (font, spacing, etc) on a page and get a report of the inconsistencies.

## Licensing

He said usually they don't use it. They're just going to end up being a zip file on his pac (sad). So normally they just leave it. Transfer of right or opensource. Last year they did transfer for amazon vouchers.

We can talk next week when we knot what we're going to do.

## Communication

They really don't have access to teams since they're not alloweod to use Microsoft stuff. They can do the meetings on Chime. Fixed slot every
Wednesday before 12.

## Advise

They want us to think of them as team members. When makers are there make sure the structure of our presentation is good. Our biggest challenge would be each other, not them.

## Questions

Will we get access to templates to compare against? No. So we will just compare things to [amazon.com](amazon.com). And they just want parameters so they can modify it for other web.

What they expect in a month: they want to know what we'll do first. And we can talk next week.
