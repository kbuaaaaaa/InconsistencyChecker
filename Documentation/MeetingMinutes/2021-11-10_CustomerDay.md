# Customer Day 1

(Customer meeting 3)

- Styles can come in different forms and applying styles to an element on the DOM can be in a many different ways. We can have selector that is pointing to an id or class and we can have a selector based on the DOM position

- We don't need to parse CSS, that is not what they are trying to do.

- Don't forget the step of making it flexible for other amazon services to use. (multiple browser, multiple sites)

- It has to be automated or manual with documentation so it can be reuse

- Each points in implementation we put in our Powerpoint does not have the same size

- We could start with the soucecode first then we might find a way to do the spacing using DOM. Or maybe we will decide that the spacing is out of the scope.

- And Adam is like "Why are you doing it in Python??" just use JavaScript XD
