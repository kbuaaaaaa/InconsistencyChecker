# Customer meeting 2

## Approaches

### CSS

- Each team uses different ways of spacing. Some use padding, margin etc. So this might be an issue.
- Other stuff are fine.

### ML

- Maybe it will not have problems with spacing but even if the spacing is inconsistent it will just be a little different like 2-3 pixel. Can ML recognize that difference?

### Is there a way to combine them?

- CSS is good for buttons and text size and other stuff but not for spacing
- ML might solve spacing but it will have to be able to deal with just 2-3pix differences.
- Maybe we can use ML to recognize the elements and spacing and use CSS to check the element

## Next time

- Make some example output from both approaches
- Give pros and cons
- How to implement

They want "pixel perfect". Every page looks similar if we use our eyes. The spaces are 20pix.

The header and footer will stay the same always.

## Templates

Should we use the homepage as standard or can we get templates?

- We probably could use the home page for a standard
- They donâ€™t have a template so maybe we should just look around?
