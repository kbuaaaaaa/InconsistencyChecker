# Inconsistency checker

Inconsistency checker is a Chrome extension for finding UI inconsistencies on webpages. 
Users can create, edit, download and upload templates, which are sets of CSS properties that define consistent elements.
The extension compares the template against the elements on the current webpage in order to find UI inconsistencies.
